 * - \b detectedChessboard [data::PointList] (mandatory): detected chessboard corners.
 *
 * @subsection In-Out In-Out
 * - \b videoImage [data::Image] (optional): image of the chessboard, can be used to display the detected and/or
 * reprojected points.

 * @subsection Output Output
 * - \b chessboardModel [data::PointList] (optional): 3d chessboard model as described by the `board` preferences.

 * @subsection Configuration Configuration:
 * - \b board (mandatory): preference keys to retrieve the number of squares of the board in

 * - \b drawDetected (optional, default=true): draw the detected points onto the image.
 * - \b drawReprojection (optional, default="true"): draw the reprojected points onto the image.
 * - \b drawReprojectionError (optional, default="true"): draw the reprojection error on the image.
 * - \b distortReprojection (optional, default="true"): whether the 'videoImage' is undistorted, in which case the
 *                                                      reprojected points should not be distorted.
